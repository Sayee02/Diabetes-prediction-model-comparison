# Diabetes-prediction-model-comparison


Diabetes Prediction and Analysis in R
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling for diabetes diagnosis, using R programming. It walks through the complete data science pipeline, from data exploration to machine learning model evaluation.

📚 Project Overview
Conducted detailed EDA to understand key patterns and relationships.

Performed data preprocessing: handling missing values, feature selection, etc.

Built predictive models including:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forests

Evaluated model performances using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC Curves.

🛠️ Tools and Libraries
R (Core Language)

ggplot2 (Visualization)

caret (Model Training and Tuning)

dplyr (Data Manipulation)

randomForest (Random Forest Model)

rpart and rpart.plot (Decision Trees)

📂 Files
Diabetes in R.ipynb — Main R Notebook containing the full analysis and modeling.

🚀 How to Run
Make sure you have R and RStudio installed.

Install the necessary libraries:

r
Copy
Edit
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "caret", "dplyr", "randomForest", "rpart", "rpart.plot"))
Open the .ipynb notebook in RStudio (or Jupyter Notebook if you have the R kernel installed).

Run through each cell sequentially.

📈 Results
The best-performing model was [you can fill this once you know — Logistic Regression / Random Forest / etc.].

Key insights from the data were [you can also summarize main EDA findings here later].
